Hello, this is Oneplate, Jisoo Byeon.
I'm still kinda learning programming language and considering about getting a job as a programmer.
Yes I know that there is several branches that cannot be merged under the name of 'programmer',
but hey, I literally just started to learn about writing codes and computer basics.
Any form of help will be grateful for me, specially textbooks and useful skills and stuff.
If you want to contact me, please contact via twitter @wardrobe_cement.

Thank you!
